This research project involves a comprehensive exploration of existing literature and state-of-the-art practices. Initially, real-time raw text data was meticulously collected online following an extensive research process to ensure the reliability of the data for the project. The link to the data is saved in this repo as link.txt. The data underwent a thorough cleaning and preprocessing phase, which included tasks such as eliminating irrelevant characters, addressing typos, handling missing values, and converting text data to lowercase. Stop words like "and," "this," and "the" were removed, and issues related to symbols, emojis, and special characters were addressed. Relevant features were then extracted from the processed text data to enhance the model. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the data distribution, with a consideration of its balance. Subsequently, the data was divided into training and testing sets. Multiple models were trained on the data to identify the most suitable one. The chosen model was then evaluated using various metrics, and the most accurate version was saved. The model was finally tested using unseen data, and conclusions were drawn based on the outcomes of the evaluation.
